## Moving to NYC is a dream for many. 

## While Manhattan certainly has it's own allure, I never felt completely at home there, preferring instead the open skies and leafy streets that make up much of Brooklyn. I took the leap in 2006, witnessing an era that was punctuated by the rise of [hipster culture][0] which over the past decade has [spread][1] far and wide, and never looked back.
