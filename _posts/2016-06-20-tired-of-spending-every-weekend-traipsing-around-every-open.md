  Tired of spending every weekend traipsing around every open house in your
  price range but never having the satisfaction of that call telling you that
  the deal is yours? Worried that you'll never get on the property treadmill and
  be left behind altogether. Thinking you may have to consider the 'burbs, New
  Jersey, maybe even Phillie?

In the past week, the New York Times has featured a couple of very interesting articles talking about these very problems and what you can do to take control (kinda).

So the first problem: caught on the sidelines in every bidding war? From where I'm standing this will become less of a problem as we meander towards what one hopes is a market correction. More on this later.

New York real estate is a sport, and not for the faint of heart. You need to be a competitor, and you need to enjoy the chase. I don't want to make light of the fact that you are quite possibly dropping your life savings into these four walls, so to speak, but it really is a game.

So, rule number one: Get pre approved (no, not pre qualified silly!) Unless you have the backing of the bank of Mum & Dad, any seller is going to want to see what you've got, so put your best foot forward. There is no shame is laying out how much you can afford. The greater the amount, the stronger your chances. And don't worry about getting a new pre approval for every apartment and every price point. We are going to be shopping well below your limit.

Rule two: enlist the A-Team. I'm not talking BA, Face and Murdock. But if we are, I'd be Hannibal. You need someone to drive this boat. You want to find yourself a really reputable attorney. Not too cheap or you'll never be able to catch them on the phone (or elsewhere). You also want to have a friendly chat with a reliable lender. Do they work in NYC, or did you get the Ohio call center?Depending on what yo are looking for, you may also want to have an inspection service on call. I cannot underline how important it is that all these players play TOGETHER.

Rule three: Go hard or go home. You may have read stuff about the market cooling off (are you planning to spend more than $4M today?) but the reality is that anything below $2M is fare game and you better want it. No harm if you don't, but the time for lowball offers (say 10% below ask or more) is not now. How hard should you be 'going'? See rule number one, and stick to that limit.

Rule four: Consider (seriously) waiving that mortgage contingency. If the race is tight, this is what will make you stand out because it's as close to cash as you can get without it actually being cash (and yes, Cash is King). Now this is where you want a really tight team. Ask your agent for a guide to the latest comps. If they are any good, they should also be calling around all the 'in contract' or 'no longer available' listings to see where they landed. You also want to speak with your lender and attorney to understand what is at risk (namely your 10% down payment), but this is all a big game of risk anyway.

Let's talk about pricing, affordability and moving to the 'burbs in the next post.

Later!
